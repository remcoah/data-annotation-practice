# Even or Odd â€“ LLM Output Evaluation

## Problem Statement
Write a Python function that takes one number as input and returns "Even" if the number is even, otherwise "Odd".

---

## Output A
def even_or_odd(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"

**Explanation:**  
This function checks if the number `n` has no remainder when divided by 2. If so, it is even. Otherwise, it is odd.

---

## Output B
def even_or_odd(num):
    if num / 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"

**Explanation:**  
This function divides the number by 2. If the result is 0, it returns "Even", else "Odd".

---

## Evaluation

**Chosen Output:** A  
**Reasoning:**  
Output A is correct and uses the proper logic. The modulo operator `%` checks if a number is evenly divisible by 2. This will return the right result for any integer.

Output B is incorrect because it uses division (`/`) and compares it to 0, which will only return True when the number is 0. This fails for all other values.

---

## Notes
- `% 2 == 0` is the standard and correct way to check for even numbers.
- Division vs modulo is a common LLM bug.
- Always double-check that code logic and explanations align.
